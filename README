# Blockhain Hackathon Submission
### This README is temporary

This repository contains the submission for the BLOCKCHAIN HACKATHON by 
the team INDEFINITE INTEGRALS.

# IDEA

The Idea comprises of managin the Automobile related Sales in a 
Blockchain ledger, thereby increasing the transparency involving the 
history of the Vehicle you're about to buy.

Every Transaction, i.e. Sale or Purchase of a Vehicle is accounted in a 
BLOCKCHAIN and makes it impossible to tamper the records anyhow.

Vehicles are recognised by the Owner ID and the Vehicle ID, i.e. the 
Vehicle Registration Number. All the records of the blockchain are then 
stored into a hard database comprising of MONGODB.

## Technologies Used

For the REST API :-

* Node.JS
* MongoDB
* Blockchain technology ( written from scratch in Javascript )
